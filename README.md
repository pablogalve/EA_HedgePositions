# EA_HedgePositions

## Description
This is a money management semi-automated investment strategy designed to manage the risk on your positions

## How it works
You have to do your own market analysis to determine whether the price will rise or fall, as the EA can't determine it by itself.
Then, you set up the EA's parameters based on your analysis

The EA will then buy/sell and open/close orders until the price reaches your set take profit
